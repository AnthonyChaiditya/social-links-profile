## My process

1. Structure the HTML into containers and corresponding contnet
2. Style the card top to bottom, make adjustments on the way

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I definitely feel like I learned more about structuring HTML in a way that makes the page easier to style, by using containers for specific/related content. I also learned about best practices in regards to styling - ie how and when to use relative or absolute sizing units like rem, em vs. px. According to the blog post I read - properties like padding and margin are best suited to be sized through percentages. Relative unites like rem or em are better suited for global sizing, font-sizing and in my opinion button styling as opposed to absolute units. Viewport ie vw and vh are good for sizing of containers.

### Continued development

I feel like I'm procrastinating the usage of media queries - I also would like to start a mobile first design methodology. In addition, I have not used grid, only flex up to this point and feel like it is important for me to start using grid to get familiar with it.
